the truth never dies.
the senior hoodies are so cute <3
i'm scared of the truth but i'm tired of the lies.
"the soap in my shower makes me <propfemale> like <propfirst> cullen ; rofl, just what i've always dreamed of . <3"
nobody honks at <propfirst> mercer.
"<propfemale> guardami e decidi qui, se vuoi anc<propfemale> me ; se puoi credimi ho sbagliato, <propfemale> qualcosa dentro c’è ."
red versus blue <3
"workingg on italian and stuff ; my stomach really hurts, someone needs to come and make it better rofl . (;<3"

"it`s typical that the three nights before school starts, i can`t sleep. and i swear to god if i can`t sleep tonight i`m going to murder someone. :/"
"me : did you see that ? he was grilling me so much just now, meliss. <propfemale> stein : it`s because he`s hungry, he`s gonna eat you. : x --roflmao. i love us(:<3"
"love this weather x100000, it should stay this way forever. <3"

promise me if i cave in and break and leave myself open that i won't be making a mistake. ; night nighttt. <3
you take the breath right out of me .
"please put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay. my wish for 2010/2011 is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease, nor a choice - people who are gay are not looking for a cure but acceptance and equal rights! 93% won't copy and paste this ?"
does someone from my section wanna give me the stuff that the clarinets have to be tested on in band ? (:
"got soaked walking not even a block to my house, i'm loving this rain rofl ."
"karma`s gonna come back and punch you in the face so hard, i swear."
why does it have to be so cold outside ... ?
i just died a little inside. ; ;
must be exhausting to lose your own game.
"so apparently i have to edit an ap paper, read for ap, do social issues journal and economics homework for tomorrow. rofl guess who`s not going to sleep tonight."
"failing this english test tomorrow, hands down."
"so someone's sitting outside in their car right now, blasting <propfirst> bieber songs. seriously. rofl."
definitely did horrible on the sat subject test. whatever. i don't care.
those who hate so strongly must have once loved deeply ; they must have once embraced what they now set on fire.
"can`t sleep, so typical : /"
"half hour of sleep last night :/ screw school, i'm going back to bed."
finally gonna take the nap that i was thinking about all day<3
how can you possibly cry about losing something you never had to begin with ?
"it`s gorgeous out, but i`m stuck doing this stupid ass ap paper. life is screwed. : /"
never forget those who died nine years ago today ; both the people who died as the buildings fell and those who gave up their lives trying to save them. god bless <propfemale> and all our people<3
""" i can count the number of girls vergil has been with on one hand. you know why ? there are none. that's why. """
do we seriously have school tomorrow ? i feel like my weekend just started :/
i really want some thai food right now :/
i forgot how bad it felt when you remember it`s sunday afternoon and you have homework. : /
"all and all i learned a lesson from it though ; you never see it coming, you just get to see it go ."

"if the end is so much better, why don`t we just live forever ?"
"so i'm sitting thinking about what i should be thankful for and the first thing that i can think of is my friends ; there are too many fake people & i'm glad i found you guys, who stuck with me through all the bullshit. so screw everyone else, i got you guys & that's all i need, you know who you are, ilysfm<3"
don't do anything for anyone else ; don't think about no ones best interest but your own. being nice gets you nothing but being someone elses doormat.
ap english classwork ? has to be done for tomorrow ? almost twenty questions ? you're funny. night.
whatever. i'm done.
all i know is these last four days of school better go by quickly. :/

misery loves it`s company.
"if you have a cartoon picture as your profile picture, remove it. a group of pedophiles  made it up. they're doing it because kids will accept their friend requests faster if they see a cartoon picture. it has nothing to do with supporting  child violence. it was on the tv show that warns you about internet frauds , plus tonight's news. set this as your status to warn others!"
jensen ackles. <3
