2011-02-22 04:49:35 "people are being very nonchalant about the earthquake in christchurch. the last one was bigger but there weren't any casualties. this time, people are dead. 2 buses were crushed by falling buildings, the cbd was heavily damaged, buildings have been razed to the ground. we should still be optimistic about those who may have survived, but right now, it's not something to joke about."
