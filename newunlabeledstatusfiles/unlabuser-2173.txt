"i am free, the ties are broken, my life starts now"
"life is to full of unpredictable, imfathomable, and unimaginable variables to try and figure any of it out or to make any plans or goals  the best thing you can do is jsut float along with the waves of uncertantiy and hope you dont hit to many rocks on the way "
to feel nothing is bliss
"very tired from work and no sleep, then again the entertainment buiseness never takes a rest "
"will be completely honest for 48 hours     you can ask me 1 question (only in my inbox)  any question, no matter how crazy, sinister, personal or wrong it is  there is no ulterior motive, you have my full honesty, ill answer anything but i dare you to put this text on your status and see what questions you get "

whats worse than being depressed is knowing your depressed and theres nothing you can do about it
so life is great right now just had to go to the hospital got a hernia and now im on vicadin get to see a surgeon on monday things are deffinitly lookin up
"life is only full of depression and pain the cure is said to be love but love is just the inevitable feeling of hurt, there is no good things given out in life just bad  the only happiness to be found is what you make for yourself, never let the pain drag you down make your happiness and find your place in the world "

the things we want are forever out of reach a wall put in place never to let breech i wish i could say the things that i feel but i have to play with the hand that i deal with you i see the life that i wish for the happy ending forever more but just as my life plays out the things i want are without a doubt are forever unavailable to me words unspoken to you the man for you i can never be  written to my present

"once yet again i resort to being the walking corpse that i truely am, my life never ment for happiness and trust for all in wain  my candle now flickers about to go out, with each pressence enter and leave my life a little more goes with them and now theres not much left  hope for life is fading blackness is what i desier "
"never saw it comming, now i see life while humming, my light was out, my heart was stout, i left to lose myself, and now ive found my health, life is fiannily within my grasp, my heart no longer has this rasp, it has always been there to look over me, never will i no longer see, my candle no longer is in wain, and i owe it all to bane "
glove slap fight in the bathroom with 4 ppl = fun night
"loveing someone means carring more for them than you do yourself, for if you truely love someone you would choose your own pain over theirs, and if ever you find this in life never let it go for no other feeling on earth can match the intensity of being loved and loveing in return, and it is the only thing in this world that ever truely completes a person for without love you are only half of what you truely are "
"stuck in my own world once again, finding my peace i know not when, not sure whats going on, not sure how far i am gone, dont know what i want anymore, once i craved the love of <propfemale>, but now i want my peace, this acheing may finally cease, but something looms overhead, still on the inside i feel dead, not sure where to look, feel like a fish on a hook, maybe one day ill wake up, till then ill just finish my cup "
"why is it every time i feel like i can stand again and finally be ok with my life smething has to happen that brings me back down to the dirt, im starting to think that might be where i belong, i honestly belived this time would be different, but who can i fool i guess again i was wrong and this wound will never heal "
i finally know the path i must follow
"nothing says happy easter like a great dinner with your family, espcially when your familys great easter feast is a big ole bucket of kfc mmmmmm"

its a thought process    it happens
hate writting epic poems and then the web <propfemale> changes so shit gets erased and i cant remember what i wrote
"long to live, long to give, walking twoards the light, seeing all the plight, lying awake as the day passes, still just swimming through the masses, listen to the songs with meaning, no direction are we leaning,  learn to breath, learn to greave, grab ahold of your life, release your grip on the knife, lay down and fall your eyes, learn to dream in the ties, see things with your mind, never again to be blind "

"with every step forward is two steps back into the past, but every now and again you leap forward with no consiqunses  this is how you get over a broken heart, it takes more time this way but eventually ur not falling ne more and you just have to climb up "
"don't know where i'm goin only livin for today, don't know where i'm headed its always been this way, don't know where i'm goin but ill get there really fast, don't know where i'm headed but i always end in last "
i wish i knew where to go from here
if you had the <propmale> to hit reset would you?
how do you find purpose in something that seems so meaningless
"looking thru the spyglass, losing my own mass, waiting for the day, when i can do all i wanna say, with sweat blood and soul, ill finally fill in that hole, life will no longer be a toll, the joy i see, wrapped in thee, building my life back up, to everyone out there whatsup "
ya so i think i'm moving to canada i'm done with the way the system is here its supposed to help its ppl but all it does is fuck u over ne <propmale> it gets
"words can only comfort the ear that lives in the present for the true test of all bonds is time, and no bond weather by blood, heart, or sweat can last against the ravages of change, it leaves you to think of words or things you wish you had done and the present you could lie in, but in the end it all fades away, the bonds of mist "
"the deffanition of a good person is someone who instead of saying \dam that sucks\"" will go out of their way to help find a solution"""

"stand strong against it all, stand tall be the wall, take a bullet in the chest, shake it off beat the rest, prove why you are a force, still one thing left to change the course, one needle left in the scar, reach past thru the tar, fingers grasp hold it tight, pull out with all your might, doesn't budge doesn't wain, but this goal you will obtain, focus hard pull again, standing tall you are a man "
"behind open eyes i see untouchable memories, behind closed eyes new ones are made from nothing, sometimes i wish i could go blind "
"is it possible to die if you've died once before, stuck behind a vail, an image no one sees, looking for reality "
when you spend so much time trying to master how other people think sometimes you lose track of your own thoughts
"maybe the point is to forget your past and move to the next e playful erience, not lock yourself in the place of your past trying to figure it out, weather it be people or places nothing is permanent and as that is true so is the fact that everything in life is leading up to letting it go and its time to accept that "
