"you canâ€™t escape it! weâ€™re all gonna die, just face it! so donâ€™t run, donâ€™t hide! make the most of youâ€™re life while you can! coz weâ€™re all dying, even if it is slowly lol a little serious you think"
it is the journey to your destination that makes you happy not the destination itself   teehee
"as society becomes more and more complex we as human, the most complex organism on this earth, seek simplicity  is it irony or is it that we love to be diffrent and be individuals "
"as we are growing up we run into all kinds of new responsiblities  when we were children we would have shyed away from these things because they may seem like too much work, but as we are today we see them not as hard work but as a way to show not only other but ourselves that we truly are growing up "
"emotions are a important part of daily life and without them our society and possibly our world would fall into total turmiol  there are three parts to it the very emtional people, the no emtion people, and the balanced  it may seem that the balanced is the best but without the extremist some accomplishments may not be around today  so don't forget about them "
im on a roll today or this morning  wat ever  i have been listening to much to the philosophers  lol
some look forward to death and other are scared of it  for me im waiting for those few years before death because at that age after all the e playful eriences you have been through you will not be afraid of death nor want to die but instead know what is wait for you and accept it 
i love those anime where they make the main character look very playful but when he she needs to be they get really serious and good

we were talking about prolife and prochoice in english and then <propfirst> showed me a argument two people had about it so i want to know what you all think 
"be honest ! if you think i'm cute , like this status   \if you love me , put a ?   if i'm your friend , put a  smile    \if you ever wanted to go out with me , poke me  \if you miss me , put a  annoyed   if you ever had a crush on me , \         message me saying so   if you're not scared , post this as your status"
we all can trust but can we trust trust? sometimes u can trust in thing but the end up letting u down and that is where the question comes from  trust can make great things happen or it can destroy everything  people never notice when it helps only when it hurts so they think it is bad to trust 
what if trust makes something beautil happen and then something twice as bad happen does that mean trust is bad or just how we view how bad that thing is  it is a very confusing subject that i will leave up to u the readers to discover for ur selfs and have ur own opinon although i already have mine 
can feelings feel physical?
