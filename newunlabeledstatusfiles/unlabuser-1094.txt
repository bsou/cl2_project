r i p <propfirst> jennings 
got nominated to attend the national youth leadership forum on law and crime scene investigation   i don't know if i'll go though  gotta have money for it 
lets not pretend that im invisible because it only hurts  not like it matters to you but it does to me 
i have contacts now!
is it so wrong to want to be loved and accepted for who i am? apparently it is so therefore im just over it  life is too short to be playing mind games  if you like somebody then dont be chicken and not tell them 
feeling pretty good  went to fuzzys pizza party then chilled with the fam  at <propfemale>'s   wink  love 'em lots 
sup ppls  lol  im sittin here chillin with the frodo at my house  yayness  today is gonna be a good day  [even though im running on barely any sleep] whoop whoop to the fam !
isnt these shots supposed to not allow you to get sick? then why do i feel like crap?
"somedays i'd rather be invisible and then others i'd rather be noticed  i'd rather be held when i weep then cry alone  somedays i'd rather just walk in other peoples shoes and see things through their eyes, but most of the time i'm glad i'm me "
just got my first tat  reminds me of when i got my eyebrow done whoop whoop! i am inked 
sick and tired of two-faced backstabbers 
"i still like him a lot  and it hurts some to look around and see all these happy couples getting each other presents and sharing love  loneliness sucks :,("
kinda pathetic when you cant wait to go to work just to get away from an older sibling that thinks they are above you 
what's with all the double letters on made up words? smexii? boyy?lmao wow 
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  im so sick of ppl moving in  just once i wish ppl would just stop and ask how i feel on it  it may not be my house but this just makes me wanna leave and go to a hotel just to get away 
funny thing is that im not alone anymore and im happily in a relationship  the other funny thing is ive been drinking nothing but fuze and lost 5 lbs already
i can actually smile now without fear of losing it to a frown
of course when i get mad my friends always cheer me up   i love ya guys 
ill smile when i get to be in your arms once more  otherwise there is nothing to smile about 
i got my first    w2's today  now i  just  gotta do  my taxes and send them in   love you  baby  love ya <propfemale> and <propfirst> 
i miss you like the sun misses the sky at night  i miss you like a fat kid that has already ate his cake  i miss you like gir misses his cupcake  i miss you like nemo missed his dad 
im finding out more and more on what  friends have hidden from me and to be honest im disappointed
"here i forgot    fixed \i wish kayley was here right now  i could use a good laugh  i wish i was in <propmale>'s arms right now  i could use the comfort  i wish <propfemale> was here  i could use a loser  lmao  i love ya  and yes  all 3 of you mean so much to me \"""""
loving how people can say something one minute and turn around and what they said they werent gonna do tired of being told  lies 
"feeling like  poop    wait,  that's probably because of allergies  going to work  yay   "
hope he can come home   sad 
"sitting here wondering when things changed  we each have changed  more with distance, more with maturity, more with life and love  we have all grown up  our fates have begun to straighten out and our paths have been chosen just know that ill always be your sister, yiour daughter, your friend, your girlfriend  i love y'all and good night "
