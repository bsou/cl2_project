"love is a four letter word, but so is pain, they always come together and everything seems so mundane, all i ever wanted was to give you my love, but now im looking down at you from up above, you seem happy now without me, i gues this is just how things had to be, i gues this is it, saying goodbye, i just wish your love wasnt a lie"

staring at the setting sun  no reason to come back again  the twilight world in blue and white  the needle and the damage done  i don't want to feel this way forever  a dead letter marked return to sender so push the seats back a little further roll the windows down and take a breath i can see the headlights coming they paint the world in red and broken glass
"dirty history, it's all the same, ain' no livin' soul gonna take the blame, for all the suicidal things i did, all the pain that was caused to acheive a wish, suffering, body recovering, struggling, when things start bubbling, can't wash away what's not seen, guess we all gotta little dirty history"
