<propfemale> not on ur own understanding for that is death but <propfemale> on the understanding of the lord which is life and fulfillment
blessed are those who know the lord and walk in ways of rightousness but cursed are those who know the lord and yet in there own ignorance still walk in the ways of sin
"i usually only do one verse a day but i just have that nudging feeling that god wants me to say this for someone who needs it  it will take two posts so read the comment to      hebrews ch 12 therefore since we are surrounded by such a huge crowd of witnesses to the life of faith, let us strip off every weight that slows us down, especially the sin that so easily trips us up "
"for our earthly fathers disciplined us for a few years, doing the best they knew how  but god's discipline is always right and good for us because it means we will share in his holiness  \\discipline is enjoyable while it is happening--it is painful! but afterward there will be a quiet harvest of right living for those who are trained in this way "
yawns so yeah overall decent weekend dad and me argued over something stupid  said stupid things but afterwords we realized how stupid it was hugged each other and played some music lol iron man by black sabath
"loveless\\act i annoyed \infinite in mystery is the gift of the goddess\we seek it thus, and take to the sky \ripples form on the water's surface\the wandering soul knows no rest "
"miageta yozora no hoshi-ta<propfirst> no hikari\miageta yozora no hoshi-ta<propfirst> no hikari\hitotsu futatsu kane no ne wa hibiku\kokoro no naka de hidoku fukaku\monogatari no you na ishi ga shizuku\sono naka niwa saizen rock tsuku\jikan to tomo no jidai wa ugoku nagareru ishi wa shizuka ni ugoku\yo to <propfirst> <propfemale> ni sumashite fine\g- surprise -d bye!"
"for our earthly fathers disciplined us for a few years, doing the best they knew how  but god's discipline is always right and good for us because it means we will share in his holiness no discipline is enjoyable while it is happening--it is painful! but afterward there will be a quiet harvest of right living for those who are trained in this way  so take a new grip with your tired hands and stand firm on"
