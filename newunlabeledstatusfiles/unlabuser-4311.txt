sitting on the couch with my baby   gotta get ready to head to the other side of the river to dogsit   let me know if anyone wants to <propfemale> out since ill be in pb 
is now at the house in pb so let me know people if you want to come <propfemale> out im so freaking bored that it isnt funny   baby boy is sleeping and im all alone  sad 
is so bored im about to beat my head against a wall   someone please text me or call me to <propfemale> out!!!!!
is going to set up her bed for the night and then relax for a while and chat on gaia so text me people if you want to chat 
is completely exhausted   going to need a nap today sometime to recharge   
is going to clean house when <propmale> decides to nap then maybe i might feel a bit better about things 
is up now after pretty awful sleep   its hard to sleep when you are upset so yeah hoping today will be better then yesterday but i have a feeling that it wont be 
is actually having a good day besides the mountain of laundry that needs to be done    oh well it will get done somehow   
is finally able to accomplish something now that the baby is asleep but first something quick to eat and then to fold laundry and when baby gets up it will be bath time and feeding time   gosh i love my life
well i feel kinda bad for waking up the baby and bathing him but thankfully he is going to go straight back to sleep and then i get to sleep maybe he will sleep good and long like he did last night   maybe no nighttime feeding one can only hope 
hmm realizing that hoping he sleeps through the night is jinxing it    oh well time to get through my day   
is making sure that the house is going to stay clean for going out of town while checking about the water    had a break in the water main today and havent heard anything about a boil order so if anyone knows let me know please 
well off to bed to wake up early for a chiro for baby and then try to see if i can get him to see the doc before we leave    damn gassiness making my baby cry in pain   i will get my revenge on you 
im back from vacation and it went pretty good car rides sucked but otherwise everyone loved the baby   hoping when we go back when he is bigger   
heading off to bed and then got to start cleaning up tomorrow for the cookout on sunday   got lots of things to do if anyone wants to come visit just let me know when   
hmm sounds like a familiar thing to me got to clean up and keep the cat off the counters    man <propfemale> vu
is needing to clean the house but i have such a cute distraction that is keeping me from doing it    
well im off to bed now i have to get up to take baby to the doctor    god im not looking forward to it but oh well i have to do it   
"is up and moving got to get baby up, dressed, and fed for his doctor's appt here shortly so it will be a fun day    "
well doctor went as well as can be e playful ected   wasnt thrilled about the shot but he is over it and is being his normal self 
hmm i think im going to stay up late tonight and clean the house a bit    well after the baby is asleep for the night and then it will be easy   but i have to bathe him at nine and then its food and bed   hopefully thats how it will go   
off to bed have to get up early for a yard sale and to clean for tomorrow so good night
hmm cleaning today while my mom does the yard sale    sounds like lots of fun maybe   
cleaning then off to bed and then cleaning again when i get up    when does it ever end?!
having a party with family today    cleaning at the moment for that lots of fun hopefully ill get everything done but it is unlikely   
had a good day   cookout was fun and exhausting   i was glad to see lots of people   now to relax and spend some time tomorrow with just me  
i have laundry to do today and then chilling out and organizing what needs to be sounds like such a fun day    hoping it stays as cool as it is right now

having fun with my baby today just chilling and getting laundry going   had to go out and get formula otherwise i would have a very unhappy baby when it runs out   lol

well its spring cleaning this week   glad i have enough music to keep me entertained lol well of clean windows and sing like no one is listening    
"if you love me (comment on my status)\if you think im a good friend (like my status)\if you would date me (message me)\if you have ever had a crush on me be honest (poke me)\if your not scared (set this as your status)"
