women are evil and men r helpless to stop it gosh i wanna be with my son my meddling family will never see another women i meet again i was damn right to keep my friends closer
always workin on my ryhmes even at work devoted to the cause
waitin to see her she could definitly be the one if she wants to  stoked !!   p s  if yur readin this <propfemale> i met someone new and im not leavin her so get over it
tired as hell of the same old shit every week why cant there be a decent bar or coffee shop in town to meet people damn i just wanna get out and be social with someone besides the typical scumbags
what did i eat that has me so screwed up tired of feeling sick my stomach is way to sensitive its like it can only tolerate alcahol and nothing healthy
i never know what to think what to feel what to do anybody else ever get that sinking feeling im afraid the waters too cold to swim maybe i should risk it rather than go down with the ship
gosh ive been saving up apartment stuff and money all this time just for my roommate to bail on me last minute now what am i suppose to do with everything my stuff is at three different places and they didnt say i could store it there indefinitely
totally pissed off but there wouldn't be any point in telling her about it maybe all the shit i deal with will just make me go off the deep end one day defintly could use something to make up for the fact fuck my life
havin sum fun tonight
hoping she will let me see my son today   but i doubt it
about to set it off gotta mind so sharp ill fuck around and cut my head off lil <propmale> is so cold but im better just wait ill prove it someday
tryin to see my boy prolly wont happen i wish she understood she not just hurting me
