using your position as a leader to force your will on others will never get you any respect and quite frankly will cause those that did respect you to lose respect!    
time to go to the gym for a workout!!!    dont know if this is a brag or not but i cut 1 minute of my 1 1 2 mile run   but it is still not a good time   brenda just destroys the eliptic machine    65 minutes non-stop     shes a warrior on that thing       
"happy sabbath everyone     i got a disturbing message from a friend of mine in texas i am asking you guys to pray for this friend all i can say is it was a suicide message and i have no way to contact him   nor do i even have an address  so i just ask that you pray god did intervene , and if not then he will be resurected into the kingdom with new hope and love   "
no word about my friend who may have committed suicide yesterday      tomorrow i will call the plano police   
o0k  texans get a new coach that has a clue!!!!  bring back <propfirst> brown!!!     jets made the play when it had to be made  they have playmakers but how do you let a guy  like edwards that open with no timeouts left???
"bills,,nice win  it is important process of learning how to win    fitz  nice comeback after bad first half that is what good qbs do, and you are a  good qb   the process has begun and we are finally on the right track!!!!   i care more about how they finish then getting the #1 pick at this point   "
"this past sabbath we had a sermon about faith, hope and  love  it made me think alot about the churches of god and how far so many fall short  with our faith it is important to have godly love, it is even more important that we love one another, and not only in words but in actions how can we claim to love god, an entity we cant see, but we dont love our brother or sister, someone we can phsically see and touch"
"  we should love our brethren with the same love we love our mother, father, brother, sister, or child  if we do not we are not following the commandments of our brother jesus christ   until we look at brethren as true brothers and sisters we are so far off of what the kingdom really is!   we believe in theory but do not believe in actuality!!!!   we are our brothers keeper   "
happy thanksgiving!!!!      everyone  what a great secular holiday!!!!!      remember everything you have to be thankful for!!!     many are not as fortunate as you!!!!!        
happy sabbath!!!!     hope everyone had a happy thanksgiving!!!   
the bills have proved again they are turning the corner and on their way  stevie dont worry about the drop put it behind u and move on   we need you next season when we make our push for the playoffs   no one wants to play buffalo these days        this team is giving us reason to shout!!!!!!    
there was a time when if i saw snow i would instantly get into a bad mood  now i smile and feel so happy that i am here and not anywhere else    there is no place else i would rather be  so let teh snow fall and i will just look out my window and smile and while i am doing that i will remember where i have been
"blessed [is] the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful "
thank you mr myers   for the sermon it had alot of meaning
"i think the jets are finding out what it is like to play a real team,,,not clevelend,detroit,cinncinnati,houston or denver   look closer and the jets have had a real easy schedule and have struggled against very bad teams      that being said this game isnt over yet"
31-3   this reminds me of when the bills of the early 90s would lose the first game to miami but then when it was very important they would hammer the dolphins and show who truly was better    
45-3        ouch  reality hit the jets tonight!!!!!!!
it is times like this that you have to stay close to god and not let any man steal your crown!!!
happy sabbath  today we have the variety show at service
"sunday night another bills win,,they are definitly headed in the right direction  4 wins in 6 games ,,they are learning how to win"

"<propfemale> koenigcogwa - upstate new york \i don't know about you guys, but for the 1st time since we started having cogwa church services there was a sense of joy, a feeling of settling in even if we are wandering in the wilderness looking for a new home  <propmale> commented on it to  just an incredible sense of peace    a sense that holy spirit is very evident  evident in the level of cooperation from everyone "
niagara falls own <propfirst> starks and the green bay packers off to the superbowl  against an evil team!!
"say what you may about big <propmale> as a person,, on the field the guy is a warrior and a playmaker  tough as nails     steelers 7-0 that may have beena tone setter"
"someone should have told the jets last weeks game wasnt the superbowl, because the way they acted after winning a divisional playoff game you would ahve thought they won the superbowl   lol   17-0  and a physical beatdown!"
it cant get any worse can it!!!  oh yes it can!!!!!   24-0
the jets have life     nice catch
i will give the jets credit for not quiting    
huge defensive stop!!!
jets did what they had to do there 12-24      
wow   im impressed   no matter what happens   since the jets now know they are good just maybe they will shut up and play!  19-24     nice comeback

"while you scream at your woman, there's a man wishing he could whisper in her ear  while you humiliate, offend, and insult her, there's a man flirting with her & reminding her how beautiful she is  while you hurt her, there's a man wishing he could take her pain away  while you make her cry, there's a man stealing smiles from her  post this on your wall if you are against domestic violence"
"35 in buffalo yesterday for sabbath services, afterwards 19 of us went to dennys for a good lunch, while others went to other places and two very devout christians went to see a ailing member who is not able to come to services, everyone served with vigor and happiness! we turned dennnys into a cogawa fellowship, we may be smaller but we definitly seem more intimate "
