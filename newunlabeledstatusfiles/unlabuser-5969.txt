feeling great ^-^   it been a while    ^-^
things are getting better with me and a certain someone in my life  joyful  i hope it keeps going up   on the other note im doing fine with my health and hope everyone else is too!!!
taking life one step at a time    probably will need to find a new place to live soon with <propfirst>    hopefully i will get a job soon   
waiting for call back   getting doubt ill acually get the job    also news update on my relationship    probably wont happen if she doesnt call by the 3rd    so ill probably start getting over it  in a bit    over 6 months of being single and trying to prove im better than i was   has done nothing for me    more dissapointment in my life   awesome just what i needed right now    
hoping for my job call today   and talking to alot of old friends trying to start back up my life that been on hold for 3 years   also wouldnt mind some heat and sun 
"just woke up 4 hrs after going to sleep to a kitten swatting at my blanket, trying to make it stop, i sat up and fond out why  there was a huge ass 2 inch <propfemale> it had claws the wings off of, crawling all over me     talk about jumping, if i had claws id probably be one of those cat of cartoons that stick to the cealing lol   "
strougling with life day after day gives no encouragement to the loner i am    got a few friends but the rest want nothing to do with me   eventually try to get more but will take a long time to trust anyone new again   still no call so i have to call wal-mart tomorrow to check up on things     i hope i will be able to do the job well enough to keep it    idk how much more disappointment i can take   
so i got a call this morning    i passed out at 6 surprise 0    they called at 6 smile 0 to see if i could make it into orientation but i never got her messege   they said they would call me back for 2nd orientation but never said when    awesome    now im even more lost than before    annd it probably doesnt look good on me seeing how i didnt pick up or go to the first one     oh well time to wash cloths   
omg!! totally random and most think im weird for watching anime    but this weeks episode of naruto sucked on graphics!!    last weeks was amazing graphics but the episode itself sucked because in the last 2 months their killing off like all the good characters    *tear* and one of them was one of my favorite ones    but good thing now though    theyre finally introducing narutos dad yay!!!!
"nothing new so far    just a boring day like always sitting here waiting for a call   playing games and watching anime -the story of my life-    not much to say besides me wanting someone- after 6 1 2 months i should be able to get someone- hopefully this time things wont go wrong like every other time in my life    hopefully   lol so just chillin waiting for my life to start, its all i can do right now  "
just got in now at   12 surprise 9am and been lighting fireworks since 9 lol   still not done but had to save some for the kids lol    bought some boxers and socks and fireworks with some money got 20 left and gave to tylers dad to help out 
so only  managed to get about 1hr of sleep after trying for 2hrs   woke up cuz <propfirst> and <propmale> were bitching about a guy being stupid on xbox live  like he always is    so now i cant get anymore sleep before i go to my job orientation at 7   sadface   
"just woke up after passing out at 810 !! only woke up cuz <propfirst> left the light on    tsk tsk and all he said was oh wahh    i got 7 till work   then another 7hr orientation    long day ahead of me    i hope i can manage to not get tired before the end this time   found an old friend that i may be able to date lol, but atm im still single *tear* lol"

repairing the peices of my broken heart    <propfemale> <propfemale> <propfirst> and my parents    thank you for being there when all i wanted to do was cry my life away      smile 
getting through a day of work is proving harder than ever    they decide to overwork me and get mad when i cant do everything at once   getting called to all four corners of the store as well as carts and carry-outs    when im the only one on    damn i fucking hate that walmart is too damn lazy and stingy to hire more stock-man   let alone actually give them hours    
going to work again today     hope it goes more smoothly than the last 7 times it went    yet it probably wont   *sighs*

"my heart is aching, my soul divided, my body feels heavy and the depression regaining    another mistake in life i wish i could take back  the one person i want to talk to is stressed because of me    if only i could turn back time so i could keep my mouth shut and do things differently       sad "
"you can never predict whats going to happen in the future  and you can only try to prevent the things that you think will happen    to live life is one thing, and to survive it is another  be proud of where you are, for just imagine if you werent the one fighter of millions    you wouldnt exist to e playful irience anything at all "
the goofy pig that tells you the show is over on a wb cartoon show
"wooww  this is fucking awesome    an  xbox that nobody can fix    a computer that nobody can fix    and sitting at home all day, everyday bored as hell because of there being nothing to fucking do     this shit is fucking awesomee!!!!!!!!"
"i will sit and wait for my <propmale> to be happy, to find my <propfemale> dancer    and live my life accordingly from there    but in the meantime i guess its my music and anything i can find that i have to count on to keep me preoccupied    *sigh*"
change your profile picture to one of your favorite childhood cartoon characters and ask your friends to do the same  the point of the game? to have no human faces on facebook only childhood memories by monday to fight child abuse  copy and paste to spread the word!
"you and i wake up in jail together  using only 4 words, what do you say to me? note: if you comment, you must copy and paste this to your status so i may comment on yours as well "
"wish list:  2 pillows, queensize matress pad(last 2 are a big wanting), pajama pants and eltric heating blanket   i will keep updating as i find out more "
curling up and licking the wounds  howling at the broken <propfemale>  laying down in the shadows watching those in the light enjoy the peace they have  never knowing the peace was given to them at the cost of ones soul    would they be <propfemale> happy if they knew the truth behind their happiness??  would they think different of the world around them?? would they care??    the price of being with the court of elders   
"there are 3 categories to people\1: not giving about what happens and going with the flow,  trusting people you dont know \2:thinking everything through, and allowing people to do what they will and ask questions later \3: and finally  my way  where you dont trust anything, suspecting everything and everyone to only do things that benefit them, and only trusting them when they prove otherwise "
"hmmm  cant wait for friday, should be amazing!!! an amazing girl?  sleeping in me bed no less?? heheheh sooo cant wait"
bored at home    any suggestions on what to do????
wishing that i could just set my own little world into reality    allowing others to see what i see when i space off into my bubble    i wonder what they would do if they knew what i really imagine doing to them    hahhahaha funny thought    <propfemale> many people staring in awe over the incredible scenes    hmmmm off i go into my bubble again rofl
been up since 7 smile 0 after going to bed at 11 smile 0 last nihgt  haha surprising never would have thought it would happen hahaha now to continue through my day
"i find myself staring at the same two pages on line: facebook, and gaia  bored as always and wondering why i cant find anything fun to do    even with the billions of sites on the web   im still stuck sitting here on the same ones doing nothing    "
hahaha so ive changed my mind   instead of inflicting my own little world upon the real world   i  would rather have them enter my world   where the laws and physics of the real world are to what i want instead of what they really are   rofl
sooooo ready for my love life to move forward    instead of being frozen here in time where all im good for is a night of fun and a <propfemale> out <propmale>      my heart longs to be held and i long for <propmale> solid proof that im not a toy   that i wont be here for much longer   
fuck my life     fuck the world    i just lost her again and my second <propmale>    now shes with someone else and i cant do anything about it      she says she wanted me that he was ready but it was never made clear that she was      and now i feel dead inside once again    and once again lost the love of my life     fml
needing a day to just let loose    to forget about everything and have fun   to just say fuck you to everything that wants to ruin my mood    and to not care about anything   doing things that make me happy     my true fuck the world day     
"i would like my facebook friends to comment on this status, sharing how you met me  but i want you to lie  that's right, just make it up  after you comment, copy this to your status, so i can do the same  i bet half won't read the instructions right "
"i see you walking home alone, your face is alive and bright\but you can't see how weak you are 'cause i could end it tonight\it's the feeling you get when you think that someone behind is watching you\well i can tell you now, that someone is me and i'm about to make it right"
"my life is like an hourglass   the more the bottom is filled with sand the better my life   and right when i think everything is going well and there is no more sand left to fall    someone tips it over and my whole world turns on me     broken-heart, shitty school, no money, no job, no car, friends lost, and lost in a void of my mind    one thing is though   the sand wont start flowing again without someone there  "
     i need a hug    
"wishing there was a bucket full of pieces of paper that had the names of decent women i could have a relationship with   and that all i had to do, is close my eyes, reach in, and grab one of them  and from there, try to make things work as best as possible  to make her happy and get myself out of this hole i have dug for myself "
