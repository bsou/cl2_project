"there are 3 types of men out there (when it comes to women) \1  this man controls a woman through her body, a typical man, he sees only her exterior, and makes use of only her exterior  he cares little for emotional attatchment, and longs for lust \2  this man controls a woman through her mind, he is a pimp, he feeds her fuel for him off her own weakness, off her dependency  like a drug, they become addicted to him, and like every druggy, no matter how bad you tell them, that they are for them, this man will continue to infect  he cares nothing for emotional attatchment, yet he finds malicious satisfaction in having control over a persons mind \3  this man controls a woman through her heart, he is a romantic, he fuels their relationship, not through physical <propfemale>, yet through emotional attraction  this man looks inward, before looking outward  although he may see the worst, he can dictate the good from the bad, he uses reason to listen to her  he retaliates to her self diminishing cruelty, not with harsh remarks, yet with wisdom  he cares greatly for the well being of the woman, and finds a strong emotional attatchment "
