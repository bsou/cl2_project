it's hard 2 watch as others cocoons open to reveal the most exotic creatures and yet to kno that ur own was unwraveled b4 it wuz formed it's hard to live in a place or time that you don't belong in and even harder to pretend that you do 
"ironic to be lead on like a mule and a carrot, to be teased with possibilities never to be accomplished,and scorned into distinct oblivion by those you trust most"

dont you just hate when people get in your business
"ael p -i try so hard- - ael p\-i try so hard-"
at the moment a lot is pressing deeply onto my shoulders i feel smothered by the weight i carry whenever i finally let go for a while something happens to increase the pain now i find ithard to even give a damn 
i hate fake ppl
