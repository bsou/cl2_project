"im better now i let myself get the best of me&sometimes thats the worst life is hard,but u have to find a way to be on top of it   if u try to <propfemale> its weigh on ur shoulders     it will crush you "
so life has been hard    and only seems to be harder with every right step you try to take     so im struggling to find a sense of piece&comfort when everyone&everything i love&care about are falling away from me    but i refuse to be a part of the lie im better than that&deserve more   but its soooooo hard to watch it fall apart knowing it will never be alright again 
"so i feel like ive finally at the point in my life where there is no room for failure   ive woked hard to have what i have,and i will let nothing stop me from obtaining the success that is within my reach     i love who i am and what ive become if i had to go back and go through it all again all the pain,all the struggles,all the drama,i would     because the happiness i have now makes it all worth it "
so through all the ups and downs life has thrown my way     it looks like im onthe up more than the down    i will never forget my past    but nor will i ever repeat it 
people only get away with what you let them get away with   
my thirtheen year old lil girl just told me she has a boyfriend!!!!!!!!im not takin it too good   what do i do
"life is only as good as you allow it to be  and problems are only a way to remind you that it could always be worse   so through it all,always remember to smile     it helps!!!!!"
how do i unhide someone on facebook if i hit hide by the person?

"so its saturday and another weekend with nothing to do    nowhere to go   and no one to do anything with life is dull   but sooooooo good,because im free,and have a wonderful woman to share life with my worst day out here is better than my best day on the inside "
"so first and formost    id like to send a huge thanks and appreciation to my lady   love ya babe  if it wasnt for her my life would be sooo much harder than it is but she really does everything she can to make sure my life is good she gives and gives    and when i dont think theres anything left to give,she reaches in her heart and gives some more  its time i give my all as well she deserves it xoxoxo"
"this is the point from which i can never return and if i back down now then forever ill burn   this is the point from which i can never retreat,cause if i turn back now there could never be peace   this is the point  from which i will die or succeed,livin the struggle,i know im alive when i bleed   from now on it can never be the same as before,cause the place im from doesn\t exist anymore!!! im on  a whole new level"""
"you know ur doing alright when you never see you gas light come on    or hear ur stomach growl     or hear \lights out\"" i love my freedom   but i love my soberity more but most of all i love my wife she gives me that reason to stay clean and keep my ass out the pen i love you babydoll """
"more work,work,work       some time to play would be nice but the life that work brings is well worth it maybe i'll get to play soon "
"another day up with the roosters i never thought life the right way would be sooooo hard    i have my moments of frustration,and wanna say fuck it   but i aint goin out like that ima keep pushin "
love and let love
