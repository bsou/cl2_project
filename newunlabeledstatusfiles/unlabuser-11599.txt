yay im in st george i can see the sky omg 
"muahahaha i have my car, fathers day is almost over and im leaving tomorrow  i am strangly happy "
im bold omg im bold 
in everyones life there is a time when everything seems to be going so right but you must always remember that no matter how great things are something can always go wrong and it always does   but on another note i went to see transformers today awsome mo
well its been a long day been watching caseys sisters boyfriends kids all day and also have to say a happy b-day to <propfemale> and now im going to pass out good day my friends     i said good day!
its kinda sad everyone got on him for being a pervert and now that hes dead everyone suddenly is all sad it stupid 
ahhh so bored i have my car but i dont have anything to do so bored 
hahahahahahahahahahahaha
its such a nice day today 
life is a most interesting thing it can make you happy enough that you feel you can die happy and it can also make you sad enough to hate the world makes you think sometimes about the choices we make and how they effect how you see and think of the world 
imagine the world around you is just a dream imagine for all the years you live it is just a one night dream that in the end you will awaken from to find a diffrent life in a diffrent body now think what would you do to remember this one night dream after
heres a subject for you what is the meaning of love? do you truly understand what love is or how it feels? can you understand your life and how your emotions effect the way you think and react? and finaly do you understand just how strong of an effect an 
if money makes the world go round what happends when you have no money? does your world stop?
ever wonder what the meaning of life and death is and how it is a neverending circle of death and birth and death again followed by rebirth 
if you live through the present it becomes the past we must not forget what happend in the past but we must also remember the lessons of the now 
lonely im so lonely i have nobody for my owwwnnn im so lonely im still lonely i have nobody for my owwwnnn im so lonely 
sigh       i am so screwed 
you know i feel so loved sometimes 
its sad iv spent most of my life surrounded by friends that i made by accident and now i have no friends and i find it oddly lonely 
pain can be taken as a lesson or a punishment depends on how you look at the situation 
hmmmmm
ever take the time to examine your feelings from a observational stand point? ever feel lonely while you are surrounded by people? ever get so angry you see red? think on what you feel it can bring you understanding that you never knew you needed 
ok ever see someone for the first time and for no reason you know you hate them you stare at eachother for a few seconds and then suddenly        you rush at them and start fighting 
ever wonder why the universe is what it is? ever wonder about what the world would be like if you could change one choice that you made? think on the subject of alternet time lines and parallel worlds  wondering if you made the right choice  wondering if 
hahahaha im so far from the drama and yet i still hear about it 
destiny       fate        divine plan          we are all just pieces in a great game some are players and some are just pieces to be used and throw away when no longer useful 
i could think of thousends of reasons to live and thousends of reasons to die but all it takes is one reason to tip the scale 
hehe everone seems to think im going to kill myself  haha
anyone who reads this comment    what if i told you i was going to kill myself what would you say?
wonder why i did it? wonder why i dont say anything? wonder why i smile at you? wondering what i know that you dont?

hanging out with sister and watching tv with my nephew punching me in the side  family sometimes you wish the blood was just alittle less thick 
friend: someone that you enjoy being around  best friend: someone who will rip a hole in your lip with a pvc pipe and laugh the whole way to the hospital 
there are three things a man should always watch out for  1 a knife in the gut  2 a shot in the back  3 a pretty women  because a pretty woman would do both 1 and 2 while looking you in the eyes with a smile on her face and she would probly twist the knife
