they say how you spend new years is how the rest of your year will go 
"well i know that its early and its too hard to think, and the broken empty bottles are reminder in the sink  but i thought that i should tell you if its not too late to say i can put back all the pieces they just might not fit the same  cuz nothings worth"
"try not to talk when there's nothing to say  kept bottled up we get carried away  then i fall, then i fall down  then we fall down  and you know that it makes me feel so ridiculous  a pocket full of posies we fall down on the inside; pretty on the outside"
i need this old train to break down  oh please just let me please break down  i wanna break on down  but i cant stop now 
"<propfirst> wahlberg, will you marry me?"
is where the wild things are 
"youre beautiful  every little piece love  and dont you know, youre really gonna be someone  stay beautiful "
i want my old hair back and i dont want to lose anymore 
"oh  it is love  from first time i set my eyes upon yours thinking oh, is it love? oh dear, its been hardly a moment and you are already missed  your heart may long for a love for a love that is more near  so when im gone these words will be here to ease every fear and dry up every tear and make it very clear  i kiss you and i know  it is love  from the first time i press my lips against yours thinking oh, is it love?"
was just an inch worm away from loving you  suppose shallowness doesnt blow away with the leaves  always wrote the right thing to say  but i dont care to read your soundless words much more  the sun cant be caught if the <propfemale> dont pull  though we could have dreamt all day if we had really wanted 
"this sunday, 1-4  a fundraiser for my cancer  stay the whole time or just drop by  everyone is welcome! literally!"
"is going to try to enjoy her last day of hair and not see this loss as a bad thing, but rather as closure and a new start, where things are finally all going to take a 180 and fall into place "
has got squirrels in her pants 
cannot enter the school building due to this near flu epidemic  so instead i get to sit around my house by myself all day long while you all live your lives  whats so lucky about that?
"time passes  even when it seems impossible  even when each tick of the second hand aches like the pulse of blood behind a bruise  it passes unevenly, in strange lurches and dragging lulls, but pass it does  even for me "
"<propmale>, i miss you terribly  i need you to come to indianapolis to <propfemale> in my beach chairs when the sun goes down  i also need to get you back "
"it's becoming increasingly difficult to suppress the urge i have to squeal every time i even think of you  ideally, i would prefer to overcome that jolt i get at simply a glimpse of your face  but then again, i think i kinda like that im jumping for you, and that i know you'll catch me when i inevitably fall "
"found myself today  oh i found myself and ran away  something pulled me back  the voice of reason i forgot i had  all i know is your not here to say, what you always used to say, but its written in the sky tonight  so i wont give up  no i wont break down  sooner than it seems life turns around  and i will be strong, even if it all goes wrong  when im standing in the dark ill still believe, someone's watching over me "
"and this is a very nice day, and we are taking a very nice walk, and you two are very nice young ladies  oh! it is a very nice word indeed!- it does for everything  originally perhaps it was applied only to e playful ress neatness, propriety, delicacy or refinement;- people were nice in their dress, their sentiments, or their choice  but now every commendation on every subject is comprised in that one word "
youre cooler than the flipside of my pillow 
"| hey soul sister, ain't that mister mister on the radio, stereo  the way you move ain't fair you know  hey soul sister, i dont wanna miss a single thing you do tonight "
"oh be calm  be calm  i know you feel like you are breaking down  i know it gets so hard sometimes, be calm  take it from me, ive been there a thousand times  you hate your pulse because it thinks you're still alive and everythings wrong  it just gets so hard sometimes  but be calm "
"theres a light at the end of this tunnel, you shout cause you're just as far in as you'll ever be out  and these mistakes you've made you'll just make them again, if you only try turning around  but you can't jump the track we're like cars on a cable and life's like an hourglass glued to the table  no one can find the rewind button now, so cradle your head in your hands, and breathe  just breathe "
"here, its clear, that im not getting better  when i fall down, you put me back together  and when i daydream, we're eating ice cream  its such a nice scene but then i wake up crying  and i know ive just been lying right here  im alone in my room  i dont know what to do  when i fall down, you put me back together "
"this flood is slowly rising up swallowing the ground beneath my feet  tell me how anybody thinks under this condition  so ill swim as the water rises up, the sun is sinking down and now all i can see are the planets in a row suggesting it's best that i slow down  this nights the perfect shade of dark blue  have you ever been alone in a crowded room when im here with you? i said the world could be burning, dark blue "
oh snap!
"can you tell me how we got in this situation? i cant seem to get you off of my mind  all these ups and downs, they trip up our good intentions  nobody said that this was easy right? after all, we're only human  always fighting what we're feeling  hurt instead of healing  and after all, we're only human  is there any other reason why we stay instead of leaving, after all?"
yellow 
i said you look so fine that i really wanna make you mine 
"if you love someone, set him free  if you have to stalk him, he probably wasnt yours in the first place "
i swim for brighter days despite the absence of sun 
"if we crawl till we can walk again, then we'll run until we're strong enough to jump  then we will fly until there is no end  so lets crawl back to love "
"oh, what are men compared to rocks and mountains?"
cannot wait to see <propfirst> white rip up the half-pipe tonight 
<propfirst> white drops it like it's hot 
"i never look back, darling  it distracts from the now "
betcha cant eat just one ruffle!
"when life gives you dog shit, get a paper bag, a lighter, and some popcorn  that way when you ring life's doorbell and run away, leaving a flaming paper bag full of dog shit on its doorstep, you will not only be fully prepared to enjoy yourself, but also completely humbled with the fact that, yes  you are the one walking away empty handed  but you are also not the one with dog shit all over their porch and or feet "
"when i see you i feel like i've got butterflies in my tummy  not like butterflies, like the stomach flu  in other words, you make me want to puke "
"last day of radiation was yesterday! finally, homeward bound!"
dont it blow your mind for the third time?
one more step and you're out that door  oh what are you waiting for? all we've got is love left lose 
"for what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbors, and laugh at them in our turn?"

monon   love 
"your life is always the post of something else   where is the present in the way that you present yourself? and it's discusting how little that you try, the existential equivalent of pink eye  guiding satans steady hand, forcing beatles to dispand  it's ego freaks and drama queens, the young at heart know what i mean "
"can put her hair up in a ponytail for the first time in exactly a year  chyeah, im pretty damn psyched "
"so we think that we're important and we think that we make sense and we think there's something better on the other side of this fence  and you can soak your bread in gravy, you can soak your bread in soup, but the car that you are driving doesn't really belong to you  so you know you'll always be waiting, always be waiting for someone else to call "
jet is effing love 
"nice turn signal, jackass  last time i checked it was to the left of the steering wheel  you know, that thing you flick before you come to a dead stop in the middle of the street?"
what's in a name? a <propfemale> by any other name would smell as sweet 
"<propfirst>  i can say im sorry, but it won't make it any better  i can say i understand what your going through, but that wont make it any easier  all i can say is that its not fair  keep fighting kid  cause your tough as shit  i love you so so much and i miss you and i hope i get to see you soon "
"if you believe there is a god please pray 4 a miracle 4 my friend <propfirst>  he's only 10, has brain cancer and is being told there's nothing more that can be done "

"it's esimated that only 1 1% of people under 20 face cancer  at 24 7%, most people will face this between the ages of 65-74  at 16 years, i have e playful erienced what not even a quarter of you will ever have to e playful erience  to overcome this as well as other obstacles, i had to grow up  for this, i am lucky  i know who my true friends are, what matters and what's trivial, and exactly what im going to do; seize the day "
