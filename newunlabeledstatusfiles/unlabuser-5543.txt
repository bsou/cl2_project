happy turkey day and all that jazz

"112 although we didnt have much time to be around eachother, the time we did have was fun hope we can chill again"
i hate when a lesbo chick act like they can kick my ass and they like 4 feet tall
shout out too the calm cool gay chicks
"i will never hit a girl , i will never strike a lady , i will never place my hands on a woman , but i'll slap a bitch in a second       i'm i wrong please reply fb"
there we go steeler's
fuckin butter fingers get it together shit
not just yet cheese heads
"cant hate , its not in me congrats packers"
"listen here, to anyone who thinks i was the only one cracking jokes on people , i took it as well as i gave it so let it go the past is the past, we are grown now lets move forward  ps i still got jokes so just in case you think i lost my swag bring it !"
"good morning fb, had to get some shit off my chest yesterday, but i'm good now and ready to start anew"
"calm, cool , ready to handle shit,          ok fb i'm goin in"
"kicking me while i'm down is nothing, being the one who knocked me down now ur sayin something"

"why do people come down on black men in music for their lyric's, yet black women drag us through the mud on and off the track and nothing is said , well in that case brother's keep doin what ur doin , whats good for us is good for them  what you think fb"
"quick lesson for the ladies, you will never change the man you let in, so focus on the one you push out "
meaning mold your own sons and stop trying to fix another woman's mistake
"for the hood chicks, as far as yo man is concerned jus respect it and accept it cause you aint gon check it  "
"just in case your looking at my <propfemale> go to the note section and read my take on being the quote \realist in the hood\""  your feedback is needed"""
