 wtf is wrong with the place we call the land of the free when everything we do is controlled and dictated by someone else who is supposedly better than we are?
life is an adventure  live it the way you want to the most imortant thing is that you are happy and making those around you happy  never give up on yourself or the people you love  live
i miss living by myself  time wasnt an issue and it was so much more fun cant wait till i get my dorm at schriever 
life is too short to waste  live it to the best of your ability  never take it for granted  laugh often and never forsake friends and family  just live 
most exciting part of the week: falling through my friends parents garage ceiling 
life is a game of russian roulette  stepping outside is spinning the chamber  opening your mouth is pulling the trigger
