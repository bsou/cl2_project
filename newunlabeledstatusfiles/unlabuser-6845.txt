sometimes we dnt know how big of a step we take until we take them but we r makin a difference with every step so keep on stepping everyone!
"i hate <propfemale> ppl rush me,i hate <propfemale> im talked down to me,i hate <propfemale> ppl treat me like a four year im frazzled,frayed&pissed off& the ghsgt aint helpin a bit! < sad >"
im not 4     im 17 and i know wat im doin im not stupid or retartded so dont treat me like i am   
i feel sick    emtionally i feel sick 
sometimes we lose our way we get mad at everything and anything but we have to remeber that its our fault we are like this way or that way you start by forgivin yourself and others so you can live the life you have always wanted   so start forgivin and live   
"flames to dust,lovers to friends   why do all good things come to an end?   come to an end    nelly furtado"
