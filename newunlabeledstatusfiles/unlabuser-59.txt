i'd be lying to myself if i said it wasnt a dream 
"its time to spread our wings and set soar to the lives we've known were coming  lose ourselves in the midst of it all, and let go of the fears that hold us back  life is but a game  live it to its best "
"just got off, but im not tired  bullshit"
"damn this shit just damn it all  we dont want it, but you need it  leave it be, forget it  and maybe, just maybe it'll all go away "

"im officially 18, and tonight the partys at larrys house  its time to get crunk!!!!"
"our mistakes in this world define us  they build us up and they break us down  all we can do is live past them and try to learn from them  hopefully everything is for the better now, but whats it really matter  life always moves on "
"one day the world will see what it has reaped  it will fall just like it has before  we are young in the age of earth, for she is ancient and unforgiving  she will not let it stand much longer "
"the music blares, we all stand still  we hear every beat, we feel every note  life is like a <propfemale>, very badly written, and mistakenly open ended  is this a crescendo, or a morose \diminuendo? i guess only time can tell as we continue to listen to the <propfemale> that we call life "
"days come and days go by, almost like nothing ever happened  the only thing we have to remember them are the memories and the scars  so learn to live  make the memories, get the scars  they only hurt once "
"so whats the count, like 180 more days starting tomorrow and its finally over "
"another day gone by, another thought dripping down my spine  the day we see it all will be the day we reap what we've wrought "
"these days everything is like a passing rain  its all come and go, and sometimes you get left out in the cold  maybe you'll get lucky and have some company while you're out there  after all, who doesnt enjoy playing in the rain?"
"sometimes in life you're up, others, well you're just not  and for those times when you are up, it feels like you're never going to come down again  and when you're down, it feels like you're never going up  this wonderful circle of life "
"round'n'round we go  our eyes meet, and they quickly look away, as if frightened by a thought  scared for a moment by a creeping dream remembered, buried deep and rooted in  why dies it burn to see it, that look? when i catch your glance, and it departs from the field  3 strikes and nothings left  and now  i cant even count the strikes on my hands "
"light the sky as bright as the sun  feel the <propfemale> as it burns us into time  let it shape us, let it hold us  light up the sky, and let it take us "
"the sun shines brighter with every breath you take, the <propfemale> grows fuller with every move you make, together one may only tell that one was ever alone, but apart they each stand out like earth herself "
"the blue sky just isnt the same when i look up and feel the blues  it seems more of a gray, and less of a happy day  so brighten up and lay a field of dreams old chap, maybe things will just go away "
"lets write a tune, better yet, lets live the beat  tap the notes, hum the rhythm  sing the song and lets get to steppin  this song is for you, it is for me  its for all the ones like me and you and  you and me  so step to the beat and get with the flow cause all we're doing is moving  two steps forward, one step back  keep it up and maybe you'll get it  all ya gotta do is love "
"when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while "

this life we lead has many roads  how are we to know which path is right and which is wrong? so many different choices that affect so much more than we know but how do we know where to go? sometimes this life we lead is harder than the life itself and it leaves us empty and baron if we sray the wrong way  please just let me choose the right path

"maybe a little late    but happy new year, maybe this year some of the people who live on here will find some kind of life  lol"
"the days stack up, but the weeks fly by  every step is a decision we make so step in the right direction and things may go your way  you never know when you're going to wake up and your while life has flown by "
im breeding a monster within me  growing and changing and always hating  it takes it all but its not enough  maybe its time to be the monster ive become 
"im playing on a tight string  one wrong note and the string snaps and the song is ruined and everything ive lived through, love, hate, anger, depression, happiness, lonliness, high times and low tomes, will all have been for nothing "
"theres something right over the horizon  things are about to change, things are about to get big and the wind blew me in the right direction  im gonna ride it out and see where i end up "
yay    work  smile 
sleep and a shower sounds great
"who knows what, you know who, we all know it was but you'll never know who "
living in this place is like jumping on a trampoline  you go up and up but you always come back down sometime 
this game was old when it started  dont push it 
spinning round and round this merrygoround goes  up and down we go  slowly spinning but never stopping but i dont think i even want it too 
"nothings ever going to be the same, so i guess all there is to do is step up to this new development and start again "
"on a plane or a train or even a boat or a car, lets leave this place and never return  the memories can only do so much before they tear us down  so leave them here with the rest and begin again "
the dark side of light was never meant to be shown  its a nightmare in paradise covered with smiles  let it be and itll be okay they say   but who are they to say anything?

"yesterday i didnt see the world the way i see it today  everything was different and now things have been misconstrued and id even know what im looking at  but what i do know is you, and thats my faovrite part about tomorrow "
