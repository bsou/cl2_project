"is just sick of crap an liars \sht happens    playful "

"sittin with my mind full of bs   im such a good liar   playing with fire   living life in disguise, can't keep up with these lies\you do anything to try and catch me out, but i never leave no signs\in my heart we was meant to be\but guys like me be like two or three\i can't help myself i love girls, i can't kick out playing with fire"
its hard to write what i need to write today    what has happend to me isnt the best thing ever   but im following intuitions on this one   life isnt what it seems to be but i wont give up on my morals    needs to go back to church   and i know that sounds wrong but its true      smile 
"lifes insane, crazy, but we live in our own realities of things, and hoping that one day we will never come to them sometimes  but of all things just enjoy while you there  smile "
just reminding myself why i love it down here    more freaking snow i heard in the forecast come on ppls thats rough lol i can deal with rain but this rain is to turn into snow yucky    lol missing my ppls already i love you all     smile 
feels like crap today ppls   still waiting on that crappy snow were getting    needs to find a book and some time to relax and feel less crappy today    maybe do some writting and clear my thinking      smile  miss you guys love you all

so why is it that we fall for the most obvious things   do we really have issues   i know my life aint fair but i love the people in it no matter what   love you all miss you all  smile 
love is so over rated but forbidden love is hard to find for the rest of your life     smile 
-----i will stop loving you when my music stops and forever ends---

alright ppl things have changed   those that understand what i did know the best reasons why   but im happy can you blame me lol  smile  when life takes a turn enjoy the fcking ride lol
"im about to scream at the top of my lungs and say fck it    its about to get to my head and im about to have a break down   mentally,physically,screamin at the top of my lungs slamming doors and all she says as she shrugs \fck the world this is my time to run my own world the way i want too!\"""""

is startin to think some people are rubbing off on me lol purples going to be my new color i like again lol    thanks <propfirst> lmao    is starting to enjoy this set up more and more   love hanging with the kids  definately more trampoline fun lol  smile 
trying to make people understand things just end it! its not worth the aftermath later    imagining how your other significant other may feel fighting a fight that needs to be dealt with the source itself not the person telling the truth   
"its not funny to say things about people close to you dead even if its a baby im telling you thats a nerve waiting to happen   pls understand we have feelings even if we hide them away from anyone, its nothing intentional, but its stupid to cross someone like that tho   "

starting to be in that mood again wondering      when life is full of complications how far will you except them     how far will those questoins and doubts go     and is there really something better out there? life is complicated but as much as i hate to say complications are the only way to make it through life just got to make the right choices     just when does it get easy for me?
its going to be a slow night i see it already    
"quoting movies: \\don't know what your generation's fascination is with documenting your every thought    but i can assure you, they're not all diamonds  \roman is having an ok day"," and bought a coke zero at the gas station  raise the roof \"" who gives a rat's ass? \"b28073f2f6b506b37d60df3a830622e8,somehow that thought comes into your thoughts and makes you ask yourself why now does it come up?but you ask yourself with everything in your head is it time   ?then you think back and tell yourself no matter what everything happends for a reason    wether the outcome is what you une playful ected   
so why is the person you want to get ahold of doesnt answer you   ever   what the hell   now many theories go thru your head they are busy   unlikey   talking with someone   possible   are they with someone  ding ding   so these theories go on all day and your head gets more crazy   why arent they spending time with me   is it me or is it them being stupid   
have we let ourselves get this low to let others back in cause we love them so much   have we let outselves fall into the game of deciption that reveiles thy true self   arrougance goes a long ways but playing the game gets old as hell   
wants to have a scream fest with someone      i have lost my freaking mind     
i swear to god everyone im not ignoring anyone i promise i dropped my phone in the stream at the park   yea i know im an idiot   trust me when i say this im having a hell of a day right now can it get any worse than what i did already
