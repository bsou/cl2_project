have you ever just got tired of being nice    have you felt like you just wanted to scream  i was angry at nothing    a strange feeling if i do say so myself  it's good to just stomp and yell at nothing    nobody could really be as nice as i try to say i am lmao     or can they? nah    i'm just kidding myself and the whole worlds supporting my dilusion lmao 
"life's confusing    sometimes you feel happy, sometimes you feel sad    sometimes you're sad because you're happy    that's just so damn retarded   "
"i've been called quite wise for my age, that i'm full of great wisdom, but i've also been called a fool and an idiot    does that seem right to you? \and then there's the fact that i have all this wisdom to give to others and not a word of it ever applies to, or helps me    does that seem right to you?"
somewhere between blah and    blah
"a wise man once told me that <propfirst>, like possiblilities, start with nothing and they never stop \finding this an odd notion i reply to the man that what if it's the other way around, what if <propfirst> start at the infinate and ended at zero, and are thus the complete oposite   "
"part 2\the wise man was baffled by my statement, though idiotic, his mind, ever trying to give meaning to everything, had just drawn a conclusion that was as pesimistic as his first was optimistic \not knowing what else to say the man replies i don't know"
"part 3\at this point i stand up dust myself off  i prepare to leave and then i hit the man with more knowlage     i say to him, you do know that <propfirst> don't stop at zero right? they keep going in the other direction too   \i'm not sure if that really is a good thing or a bad thing though   "
off to make pancakes
"wow    two important southpark facts \a  <propmale> is mysterion\b  <propmale> is aware of every time he had died    and he's aware that noone realizes he died \<propmale>'s a fkn superhero     who knew    "

well i guess i'm getting into the <propfirst> game    if you want me to post something about you just give me a number lol
39  part 1  we've known eachother a long time  we've had some good e playful eriences and some bad    though you're good about making a joke of the bad moments lol  there's been times where we were close friends and at times we barely knew eachother    but through and through we've stayed close friends pretty much throughout 
"39  part 2  you're a good friend and a good person, someone i know i could go to for all my troubles, or if i need a new perspective on a topic, and you're never afraid to speak your mind  there's no amount of words to thank you for being there for me, but if you ever need a friend for any reason, you can count on me "
"15  part 1 you've been there for me more than any other person alive, and i haven't always been the best of friends to you  you're the first person i thought i could spend the rest of my life with and the first person i said that i was inlove with  our relationship has changed considerably since i've known you, we're now simply friends, best friends or good friends, your choice "
"15  part 2 you're cute as a button and you have the figure every girl dreams of having  i think of all the girls in my life i had a crush on you the longest    a crush that i've only recently gotten over  you have my undying loyalty, and you know no matter what i'll have your back "
wow    on that new <propfemale> son comercial that guy's sister isn't even a person   
"lmao, how nurotic is it to like your own comments lol    wonder why they even give you the option    "
"when you e playful ect to much\and you're full of pride\everyone you love suffers"
