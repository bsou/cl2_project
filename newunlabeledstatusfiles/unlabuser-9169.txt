"you know, after actually visiting actual universities, going back to community college is kinda depressing"
finally i go to a game where the astros win!

i wonder who came up with the idea to have to take all your classes tests at one time  a sociopath perhaps   
i eat finals for breakfast    and sometimes a late night snack
wish all finals weeks would be this easy
"just got blitzed on a reporting final  love it when teachers make their tests sound small and easy, then all of a sudden bam its an hour and a half later and you don't know what the fuck happened"
"i love it when teachers change up shit at the last minute  for example, making a project worth 250 points in the syallabus, then changing it to 450 points on the last day because he talks too much and couldn't get to everything that was supposed to be done, thus forcing him to made everything worth more  fucking fantastic"
slept to 11  i love summer

has a hard time believing he will actually be moving out in in 2 weeks  and is super excited about it smile 
bored
"so much to do, yet so little time to do it in"

"in soviet russia, you don't climb tree, tree climbs you"
"its so strange to think about where and who you were a year ago compared to what you are today  almost everything is completely different for me  theres some good in those differences, but there is also some really goddamned depressing things in there as well  seems like for everything i gained something was taken as well  life is strange"
its so nice to have people over whenever ya want and not have to stress or wonder about what your parents think about them
