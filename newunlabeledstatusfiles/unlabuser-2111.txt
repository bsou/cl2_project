"\i swiped some gin and i'll reinact the passion of the christ!\"""""

"there's no hell and no hiroshima, chernobyl was a coverup, the world is really all in love"
burnham family reunion trumps mayhem and flaming lips on the 24th  it hurts though   
is swearing off of octopus
ever notice that people often get shorter when they're mad?
"i hate when people think my \stop colaborate and listen\"" shirt has anything to do with diplomacy  it doesn't """

"now i do kissing with only one mission, if you like to kiss then you have my permission and i've already spent too much time doing things i didn't want to, if i want to make out all the time you can bet your black ass that i'm going to"
"hangin out, down the street, the same old thing, we did last week   not a thing to do but talk to you , we're all all right, we're all all right   hello wisconsin"
would like her guitar strings to finish stretchin' out and stay in tune
won't waste her life on one side of an ampersand either
"it aint about losing your mind but if you happen to, that's fine"
"a hug, a sandwich, and a nap "
starting to think that the hokey pokey really is what it's all about
just prayed to a man who doesn't exist
<propfirst>'s stomache is a metaphorical volkswagon full of clowns
if you love me you'll apply to t-meads and tell them that you have no hobbies or sports   they need people with flexible scheduals and i would loooove some more awesome people on staff
i guess i like reality better than facebook   come find me
"bahaha i was just described as so gay you can \taste the raimbow\"" by standing next to me!"""
just discovered a rip in the crotch of her favorite jeans
"second ammendment, baby"

"fire it up, fire it up"
you won't let those robots defeat me
