"love is never wanting to lose faith, never wanting to give up, and never truly moving on  love is knowing and praying in the deepest part of what's left of your heart that they feel the same "

i want some fried chicken 
3oh!3 is absolutely hilarious with my first kiss     she will never get enough once she gets that little touch if i had it my way you know that i'd make her oooh     funny stuff
never been so bored in my entire life     txt me 6746475
i think its so funny how ppl talk about you and pretend like we dont know who they're talking about; they need to be straightened out    helovesme!
"things happen for a reason i guess   so im officially 'grounded ' no phone, no weekends, no nothing "
"these dudes is hilarious! 3? t h r e e ? im gettin it, haha  headin for my state; alabama; friday; sooo ready"
wondering how i've ever made it this far    hope the diagnosis isn't too harsh (dr's office) cancer; my sis; my aunt; i hope not me too  we'll see how it goes and i'll see what the heck this thing is    pray for me
"im deeper than you think  you just gotta get to know me, you know?"
"actually i lie, im really hurt i just need to figure out what and who i want (and need)"
"apparently i'm a bitch, idk how many times and how many people have called me that but its cool; i guess i am  smile  i could care less about th immature lil boys who call my phone and leave immature lil messages; cuz thats rite, you are immature!"
"if you really knew me    you would know that you know nothing about me \im loving that show rite now but its so true, high school is brutal; you do what it takes to fit in even if you're totally different from who you <propfemale> out with  we're scared of what others think; the main reason why one of my best friends is one of my worst enemies "
"the best thing to do is move on and forget about it rite? its easier said then done i guess    life goes on; wake up with a smile everyday; the smiles and laughs make the days go on, and its better off that way; no drama, no stress"
passing out is absolutely no fun! never had that happen before    now i've learned to drink lots of water and eat breakfast  i love ms <propmale>  smile 
"why does he always make me feel that way? its like he draws me in every time    its crazy, why wont he quit?"
"its happening all over again        why cant he just give a straight answer!? it would make much more sense if he let me kno, at least i think so "
<propfemale> you're amazing but you got to back off my cute little freshie! haha i love band camp   
<propfemale> he is the most adorable thing i've seen    and so sweet  smile  he makes band camp great! lol i had fun today 
i told him that we should take a break from things so i can see what i want  i mite be finding someone else that is more       me  i just feel bad  sad 
things are finally turning around    another half day tomorrow; open house wednesday; school thursday  smile  i want my answer but i guess thats not happening anytime soon  <propfirst> beiber is the ish! (eff the lames in band who dont like the song lol jk)
"there comes a time in life when you have to let go of all the pointless drama and the people who create it and surround yourself with people who make you laugh so hard that you forget the bad and focus soley on the good  after all, life is too short to be anything but happy "
yesterday was pretty interesting talking to khoury newbold and mikal newbold (he's funny  smile ) today is open house; tomorrow is the first day of school as a <propmale>! ootoot!

"homecoming : really ; what's that ?\ha homecoming is overrated ! - <propfemale> phillips"
"want you to make me feel like i'm the only girl in the world , like i'm the only one that you'll ever love , like i'm the only one who knows your heart ; like i'm the only one that's in command , cuz i'm the only one who understands how to make you feel like a man - rihanna"
he's special     in an all too good way  smile 
is it that hard to find decent people (meaning guys) in camden county ? you find a few that seem to look good on the outside but what about the rest ? how do you know its not too good to be true ?
its cold outside   and i don't feeling like going to school   oh well  
idk what to think anymore ; am i doing the rite thing or should i let it go ? everything is just so confusing at this point        
"you understand me, at least you say you do, lately thats enough for me, looking for perfect, surrounded by artificial, you're the closest thing to real i've seen, sure everyone has their problems, thats a given, yours are the easiest to tolerate, this wasn't what we was wanting, how we're living, but let's take this good enough and turn it to great, baby understand, we can only be as good as we both make - neyo  love "
im confident that this can work out ; somehow
its gonna be all smiles now  smile  haha i have a special gift
"all i can do is take things day by day ; happiness seems to be just around the corner , so i'm willing to wait until it comes  smile \\i realized that i'm really good at making people smile"
so <propfemale> <propmale> hit <propfemale> o'steen in her dickleg and me a katarina <propmale> thought it was hilarious    and kat you should really listen to the radio more often because you're lame! but i  love  you  smile 
"i don't pretend to know what love is, but i can tell you what it is for me; love is knowing all about someone, and still wanting to be with them more than any other person, love is trusting them enough to tell them everything about yourself, including the things you might be ashamed of, love is feeling comfortable and safe with someone, but still getting weak knees when they walk into a room and smile at you "
yesterday was good     dequan deondrÃ© <propfirst> is the funniest person ever!
i love bus rides to football games     all with my bus buddies : halie shipley  ; <propfemale> hinman ; <propfemale> <propmale>   on the way back was very fun!

"when i'm sad, he makes me smile ; when i started to cry, he dried up my tears      that's what a guy is supposed to do  wink "
