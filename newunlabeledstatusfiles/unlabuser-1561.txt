just had the urge to text an emote  pretty sure i need to stop textin so much   
should prolly get started on doing my project for english but i really dont want to

i feel like i just lost about five pounds of hair   
i have the ine playful licabale urge to fight a bear with my bare hands   
you know that saying in the land of the blind the one eyed man is <propmale>? did it ever occur to anyone else that a one eyed man in the land of the blind might be blind too? and if theyre all blind howd they find out he has one eye? just sayin   
<propmale> is a great fuckin show   
feeling bored despite having a ton of things that i have to do

we close our eyes and the world has turned around again  we close our eyes and dream and another year has come and gone 
lions for lambs is an amazing movie  very good for those philosophical moments in life because chances are <propfirst> redford already told you what you should be doing 
ok so apparently if i start smiling i immediately prove other peoples' points and lose whatever argument i'm in    this is ridiculous   
"maybe someday we'll figure all this out\try to put an end to all our doubt\and try to find a way to make things better now and\maybe someday we'll live our lives out loud\we'll be better off somehow"
going away to college is an amazing song  it just seems to sum everything up so well   
"send one question to my inbox you always wanted to ask me, and you will get the honest truth  post this as your status and see what you get (formspring without the bs )"
i got into the jacuzzi without realizing that i actually hadnt taken my phone out of my pocket    so just use facebook to talk to me  yeah im retarded
