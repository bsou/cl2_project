help\\n(let it die)
people say pain is better than nothing   but have they been pushed so far that they wish for nothing to take them away?
crown vic
and yet when the happy ones call it a day it is the collective soul of all the dissapointed dreamers that control our tired minds
when the day is done and those that are content in their disillusions turn out the lights   what are those left behind left with but shattered dreams and misplaced trust
wow   this kinda sucks
let it come and wash everything away
butterknife dull but it still cuts through
hell yea! eclipse is badass
im so sad   megan fox got married
does not like it when dr pepper disapears while im sleeping   fuck you physics

so   m2 and fitzy are starting a nightclub bakery named drury <propfirst>  his name is now snaps <propfemale> and mine is muffin man   our shirts will say butter that muffin unless someone can think of anything better!
i am just about tired of the human race 
"found him with his face down in the pillows\with a note that said i'll love her til i die\and when we laid him beneith the willow   the angels sang a whiskey lullaby"
feels really stupid
"well in my vast knowledge and wisdom \cough cough bullshit\"" i have discovered something    love is both the greatest joy and coldest pain   being in love is equal to being immortal   but the loss of someone's love is more sharp and deep a pain than any sword or bullet can reach"""
anyone who has leiker needs to comment

"i've got to get out, im tired of it all"
"sunshine sunshine is fine feel it in my skin warmin up my mind, sometimes ya gotta give in, to when your love relies, let it shine, oh let it shine"
"couldnt help but fall, but that sure as hell wasnt a nice landing"
"you and me baby aint nothin but mammals, so lets do it like they do on the discovery channel"
optimisms a thing of the past   better to just e playful ect the pain that you cant avoid no matter how much you ignore its aproach
you just gotta push through the bullshit and hope like hell that theres something better waiting for you

"we are immortal in our thoughts if we choose to be  and by god i do, so lend your pen and paper so i may make my spirit alive in these blackened vines of ink"
