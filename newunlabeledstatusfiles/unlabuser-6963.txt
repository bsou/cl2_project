beauty followed me everywhere until i killed it and wore its skin  now i'm beauty!
happy burday mother!
i'm confused and wish i had a damn car  sad 
i wonder where beauty really is?
"there's ringing in my head, i dunno who's calling but if they can leave a message after the tone i'd be most greatful  and stop calling for a while "
the ringing is getting worse and worse  i wonder who's calling  it's annoying and i can't ignore since there is pain now 
"makin' cookies and still got a headache from the ringing    dunno who the fuk calling, it's getting on my nerves 4real!"
my little sis is full of half-assary  the phone call in my head still persists 
"in on puff of smoke you have everything, then it clears and it all goes away "
i wonder if super and duper know that they are used in the same sentence when people get excited    and please people my name is <propfirst> not anything else  ya'll kinda make me forget who i am when you say i'm someone different 
"well it seem dumbasses have brains no bigger than, it's fun when they don't know how stupid they really are  i luv being fantabolous!"

"yesterday is history  tomorrow is a mystery  today is a gift, that is why it is called the present  -oogue"
why do i feel like that i am the only person who enjoys ever millisecond of my life? (and it's the most boring life ever!)
why is it that everyone can't see beauty as i do? i wonder if some were blind they would see what's really good 
1408 (a movie) makes me wanna go to a haunted hotel and see my own e playful erience  i wanna stay on the 13th floor of a hotel  wink

i wished stars would fall outta the sky and something falls on my head  that was cute  annoyed 
"woohoo!  lightning and thunder  eh, i could have done without the damn rain "
"tiff refuses to share her lunch, soshe's gone and hid in the bathroom to eat  poor employees of ace "
"o o i wanna go outside so bad, i'm too lazy to get dressed though  i'm so in love with the weather right now  i can do without the rain tho "
