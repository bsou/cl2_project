what if everything you wanted to do was seconded guessed by someone else? what do you do: continue to follow your dreams and never let anything get you down? or second guess everything yourself and never live life for what its supposed to be and hold back on everything you do? whatever you choose will ultimately be heart telling you whats best

"a great man once said that love conquers all and standing armies dont  well hes damn right  love can tear you into peices to try and get that feeling youve wanted from someone all your life  but the thing is is that it wont ever happen  someone or something comes along and ruins it  love once again destroys you  so yes, a great man said that and he was telling the truth all the way "
fuck you podell!!!!!!!
ive been doing the cohen final since 9 pm i hate it so much
everything happens when and where it happens  if you get caught up it in you will be torn apart     
things occur with their natural benefits and consequences  if you are lucky enough you'll get mostly benefit  i don't know about you but i found my benefit  sure it comes with consequences of their own but i'd would rather live with them than not have it (her) 
a bit depressed and out of it      annoyed 
i feel    broken
so blah and annoyed with everything   you know how to reach me
fuck it i just end up getting hurt
 love 
fucking passed baby!!!!! haha gunna go to kfc now and get dinner lmao

is miching someone
finding that one person that youll deal with everything for has the greatest feeling ever  love 
youll neevr win the battle of love  over and over it will beat you down  but for me theres only one person that i stand a <propmale> with
running away from your problems dont solve them  it saves them for later to build up  before you know it you got alot of shit to deal with and realized all the people you lost
